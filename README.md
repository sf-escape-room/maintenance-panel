# Maintenance Panel
A maintenance panel used to override the sliding door.

## Idea
In order to open the sliding door to exit a room, a maintenance hatch needs to be opened that reveals some sort of maintenance panel. The maintenance panel needs to be overriden to unlock the sliding door. 

## Implementation
A switch board needs to connect the inputs with the outputs correctly.
